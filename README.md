Onion Architecture: (Yes/No) 
 
Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?
 Yes
 
 
MVC Pattern: (Yes/No) 
 
Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?
 Yes
 
 
Web API: (Yes/No) 
 
Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?
 No

 Benefits: (1-3 keywords)
 
 
Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)
 -Scalability
 -Maintenance
 -Seperations of Concerns
 
 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)
- I mainly encounter technical issues regarding C#, for I have little knowledge regarding the language and Packages.

 Components: (1-3 keywords each)
 Briefly describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the MVC pattern.
 -Model - This is the representation of Data
 -View - The User Sees this
 -Controller - This has The Logic

 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Have you encountered any challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects? If so, briefly describe the issue(s). (e.g., Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application)
- Same with Onion Architecture, I know the theory Behind MVC it is very simple, However C# is a huge problem for me, I little knowledge of C# and packages.



Differences from MVC: (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.
- Its hard to put into words, API is like a bridge that connects from your program to the other, while MVC is a whole seperate program.
 
 
 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)
- I have no Idea how to use C# or Packages
